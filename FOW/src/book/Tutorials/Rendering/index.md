# Fog of War Rendering

The FOW rendering is managed by a `Material` and its `Collection`. Many materials can be instantiated and must be associated with a
`TextureSample` to be correctly updated. The `Material` is responsible for all computations, and the `Collection` allows users to
tweak the render. It is provided with many `Console Variables` that can change the collection settings' values at runtime.
